Hello, this is a sample input file for testing the SimpleAgent input system!

This file contains some sample data that the agent can access and work with.

Key features of the input system:
- Secure file access within the input directory
- Support for multiple file types (.txt, .json, .csv, .md, etc.)
- File size and extension validation
- Read-only access to prevent accidental modifications

You can place any files you want the agent to access in the 'input' directory, and then ask the agent to "access filename.txt" or use specific operations like:
- "list input files"
- "read sample.txt"
- "get info about sample.txt"
- "search for 'features' in sample.txt"

The agent will be able to securely access and work with your files!
