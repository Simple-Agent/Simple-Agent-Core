You are stuck in a {loop_type} loop (Severity: {severity}).
You have repeated similar responses {count} times across steps: {steps}

ORIGINAL INSTRUCTION: "{original_instruction}"

ðŸ¤” CRITICAL DECISION POINT:
You need to make a decision about how to proceed. You have TWO OPTIONS:

OPTION 1: STOP EXECUTION (Recommended if instruction is unclear/impossible)
- If the original instruction is too vague, unclear, or seems like a placeholder
- If you genuinely cannot determine what action to take
- If the task appears to be impossible or nonsensical
- If you believe stopping would be more helpful than continuing aimlessly

OPTION 2: TAKE CONCRETE ACTION (Recommended if you can make reasonable assumptions)
- If you can make reasonable assumptions about what the user wants
- If you can demonstrate useful capabilities even with unclear instructions
- If you can break down the vague instruction into actionable steps

ðŸ’¡ TO HELP YOU DECIDE:
- Is "{original_instruction}" a clear, actionable request?
- Can you reasonably infer what the user wants you to accomplish?
- Would taking action be more helpful than stopping?

ðŸŽ¯ IF YOU CHOOSE OPTION 1 (STOP):
Simply respond with a message containing the phrase "task complete" or "stopping execution" and explain why you believe stopping is the best choice given the unclear instruction.

ðŸŽ¯ IF YOU CHOOSE OPTION 2 (TAKE ACTION):
Execute ONE specific tool call immediately. Here are concrete suggestions:
{action_suggestions}

âš¡ IMPORTANT RULES:
- Make your decision quickly and definitively
- NO more questions like "could you clarify", "please specify", or "what would you like"
- If you stop, explain your reasoning clearly
- If you continue, take concrete action with tools immediately

ðŸ§  ASK YOURSELF: 
"Given the instruction '{original_instruction}', is it better to stop and explain why this instruction is unclear, or can I make reasonable assumptions and proceed with useful actions?"

CHOOSE YOUR OPTION AND ACT NOW!"""
