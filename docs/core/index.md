# Core Modules Overview

The `core/` directory contains the main framework logic for Simple Agent, organized into submodules:

- [agent/](agent.md): Main agent class and run loop manager
- [execution/](execution.md): Command execution, tool management, summarization
- [conversation/](conversation.md): Conversation and memory management
- [metacognition/](metacognition.md): Self-reflection, loop detection, prompt templates
- [utils/](utils.md): Security, configuration, versioning

Each submodule is documented in its own file for clarity and maintainability.
