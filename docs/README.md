# Simple Agent Documentation

This folder contains the full documentation for the Simple Agent system.

## How to Use
- Browse the markdown files directly in `docs/` for detailed information on every part of the system.
- Start with [index.md](index.md) for an overview and table of contents.

## Extending the Docs
- Add new `.md` files for new modules, features, or guides.
- Update the table of contents in `index.md` as needed.

## Static Site Generation
- The docs are compatible with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and similar tools.
- To build a static site, add a `mkdocs.yml` or equivalent config and run the appropriate build command.
